# Motoko 🎗️
This repository created for Internet Computer Internship works. I will be sharing my little project that we do in the bootcamp.
* After installing all the dependencies, we need to create new dfx project with `dfx new motoko_sample`
* Then you split your terminal to see your work clearly.

* As you can see on the left start your dfx with `dfx start`.
* Then you need to cd in your backend file that contains `main.mo` and enter `dfx deploy`

  Congrats! 🎉 You started your motoko project.
